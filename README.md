This is a Change Calculator:

It takes an amount due(how much something costs) and an amount received(how much cash you use to pay for it). 

It returns the total change due, and how much is due for each denomination fo currency from $20's down to pennies. 

To use it, clone the repository, run npm init to install dependences and open on localhost:3000. 

Then go wild with any currency amounts you can think of...
